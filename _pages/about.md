<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a graduating PhD candidate in computer graphics at Washington University in St. Louis, under the supervision of [Prof. Tao Ju](https://www.cs.wustl.edu/~taoju/). During my doctoral work, I focused on procedural geometry analysis for various applications, including maize root systems and cancer tissue. I have made innovative contributions to computer graphics modeling, specifically by devising methods to generate more robust geometric models represented by multiple implicit functions or neural networks. Currently, I am collaborating with Adobe Research to develop an innovative method for generating more precise swept volumes to address challenges in robotics, autonomous driving, and AR/VR drawing.

I graduated from Washington University in Saint Louis in 2021 with double Majors in Computer Science and Mathematics.

[Adaptive Grid Generation for Discretizing Implicit Complexes](https://jurwen.github.io/Adaptive-grid-for-implicit-complexes/)

**Yiwen Ju**, Xingyi Du, Qingnan Zhou, Nathan Carr, Tao Ju

[**Project Code**](https://github.com/Jurwen/Adaptive-grid-generation) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- The method generates a simplicial grid for adaptive discretization of implicit complexes, extending beyond implicit surfaces to represent non-smooth, non-manifold structures.

- Unlike existing techniques, it adapts to both surfaces and their lower-dimensional intersections, improving accuracy and detail preservation.

- It supports implicit surface arrangements, CSG shapes, material interfaces, and curve networks, enhancing versatility in geometric modeling.

- The approach enables efficient, high-fidelity discretization for applications in graphics, material science, and simulations.

**Yiwen Ju**, Alexander E. Liu, Kenan Oestreich, Christopher N. Topp, Tao Ju

[**Project**](https://github.com/Jurwen/TopoRoot_v2) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- Performs Fine-grained root trait extraction based on TopoRoot and provides detailed architectural traits (e.g., root number, length, thickness, angle, hierarchy) from 3D maize root CT images, addressing gaps in existing methods.

- Outperforms existing methods on real and simulated root images, improving precision in trait measurement.

- Demonstrated utility in differentiating root mutants from wild types, aiding genetic studies of root architecture and crop productivity.
